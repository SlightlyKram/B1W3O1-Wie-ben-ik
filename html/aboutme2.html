			<h3>What are your areas of development?</h3>
				<p class="intro">I certainly think that I need more confidence. I get anxious in a lot of social situations which makes it hard for me to do things like filming myself, showing something I created, presenting something in front of groups etc. I also get self-conscious with my work. When I have to hand in assignments I always feel like I messed up somehow. All these things I should definitely work on.</p>
			<h3>How were your experiences in your previous schools, what did you learn there and how can you apply what you've learned there to this study?</h3>
				<p class="intro">I don't feel like I went to a great elementary school. I didn't have subjects like English, History or Geography so I felt really behind after starting secondary school. My classmates knew certain things that I had never even heard of yet, luckily I was able to pick up the material in time. High school was pretty tough for me, I would even say that it was the hardest 5 years of my life. I did learn more there than during elementary school. We often had to work in groups and because I was an outcast I learned how to work together with people I don't know or neccesarily like. Because communication is important, I feel like learning how to work together was useful for this study. </p>
			<h3>Have you ever had a part-time job and what did you learn from them?</h3>
				<p class="intro">Sadly, I have never had a part-time job before. I was rejected on multiple occasions and that sucked a bit. I haven't looked for a job since because my parents wanted me to focus on school.</p>
