			<h1 class="h1">Q&A</h1>
				<h2 class="boven">Welcome to my website. I answered some questions that I've been asked to answer in a Q&A format.</h2> 
				

			<h3>Why did you decide to study Software Development?</h3>
				<p class="intro">It took me a long time to finally decide on what I was going to study. I wasn't good at anything and I didn't really like any of the options presented to me. My dean thought I would like this study because I like games, so it was related to a hobby of mine. I ended up enjoying it way more than I thought it would. That's when I decided that I wanted to continue on this path.</p>
			<h3>How are you staying motivated for school?</h3>
				<p class="intro">Well... First things first I am not a highschool graduate, which means I have to finish my current study or I'll get into trouble. I also found a group of friends and that makes it more fun and easier to stay motivated for school. We help each other out. So far the teachers have been nice as well.</p>
			<h3>What are you prepared to work on in your spare time?</h3>
				<p class="intro">Of course I'm willing to work on my projects if they're not finished yet, I think that's nothing special though. I'm also currently learning how to touch type. I thought that learning this would certainly be benificial for this study.</p>
			<h3>What are your areas of development?</h3>
				<p class="intro">I certainly think that I need more confidence. I get anxious in a lot of social situations which makes it hard for me to do things like filming myself, showing something I created, presenting something in front of groups etc. I also get self-conscious with my work. When I have to hand in assignments I always feel like I messed up somehow. All these things I should definitely work on.</p>
			<h3>How were your experiences in your previous schools, what did you learn there and how can you apply what you've learned there to this study?</h3>
				<p class="intro">I don't feel like I went to a great elementary school. I didn't have subjects like English, History or Geography so I felt really behind after starting secondary school. My classmates knew certain things that I had never even heard of yet, luckily I was able to pick up the material in time. High school was pretty tough for me, I would even say that it was the hardest 5 years of my life. I did learn more there than during elementary school. We often had to work in groups and because I was an outcast I learned how to work together with people I don't know or neccesarily like. Because communication is important, I feel like learning how to work together was useful for this study. </p>
			<h3>Have you ever had a part-time job and what did you learn from them?</h3>
				<p class="intro">Sadly, I have never had a part-time job before. I was rejected on multiple occasions and that sucked a bit. I haven't looked for a job since because my parents wanted me to focus on school.</p>
