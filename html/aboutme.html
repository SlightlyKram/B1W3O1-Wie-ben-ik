			<h1 class="h1">Q&A</h1>
				<h2 class="boven">Welcome to my website. I answered some questions that I've been asked to answer in a Q&A format.</h2> 
				

				<h3>Why did you decide to study Software Development?</h3>
					<p class="intro">It took me a long time to finally decide on what I was going to study. I wasn't good at anything and I didn't really like any of the options presented to me. My dean thought I would like this study because I like games, so it was related to a hobby of mine. I ended up enjoying it way more than I thought I would. That's when I decided that I wanted to continue on this path.</p>
				<h3>How are you staying motivated for school?</h3>
					<p class="intro">Well... First things first I am not a high school graduate, which means I have to finish my current study or I'll get into trouble. I also found a group of friends and that makes it more fun and easier to stay motivated for school. We help each other out. So far the teachers have been nice as well.</p>
				<h3>What are you prepared to work on in your spare time?</h3>
					<p class="intro">Of course I'm willing to work on my projects if they're not finished yet, I think that's nothing special though. I'm also currently learning how to touch type. I thought that learning this would certainly be benificial for this study.</p>
